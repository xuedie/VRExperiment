	 * Verify the amplitude data. The Throughput object receives as arguments the "amplitude" for the sequence of trials

	 * method verifies the correctness of these data. The process and calculations are different for 1D tasks and 2D
	 * tasks. The 1D case is simple: The amplitude passed is the distance between the center of the two targets -- the
	 * "from" and "to" targets. This is identical for each trial in the sequence. The 2D case is more complicated.
	 *
	 * For the 2D case, the amplitude passed to the Throughput object is the diameter of the layout circle. This value
	 * is not necessarily the amplitude of movement for the trials, even if the movements are perfectly executed. The
	 * movement amplitudes for perfect movements are calculated here, and given the label "taskAdjustedAmplitude". The
	 * calculations are different depending on whether there is an even number of targets or an odd number of targets.
	 *
	 * 2D - Even Number of Targets. If there is an even number of targets, the first trial (index = 0) begins by
	 * selecting the start target and then moving directly across the layout circle to the target on the opposite side.
	 * The movement distance equals the diameter of the layout circle. However, the next trial (index = 1) is to the
	 * target beside the start target. The movement distance in this case is less than the diameter of the layout
	 * circle. The movement distance is depends on the number of targets.
	 *
	 * 2D - Odd Number of Targets. If there is an odd number of targets, the movement distance is the same for every
	 * trial. The distance is less than the diameter of the layout circle, because the target is slightly displaced from
	 * the location directly across the layout circle.
	 *
	 * The calculations below account for the peculiarities of the tasks, as just described.
	 *
	 * When all the calculations are done, we compare the taskAdjustedAmplitude to the value "a" passed here as an
	 * argument. The taskAdjustedAmplitude and a should be the same. Because we are dealing with floating point
	 * arithmetic and there may be some integer rounding issues for the location of targets as rendered on the screen,
	 * the comparison only requires that taskAdjustedAmplitude and a are within WIGGLE units of each other (see below).
	 * If they are, all is well. If they aren't, there's a problem.
